Added :class:`pytest.RaisesGroup` as an equivalent to :func:`pytest.raises` for expecting :exc:`ExceptionGroup`. Also adds :class:`pytest.RaisesExc` which is now the logic behind :func:`pytest.raises` and used as parameter to :class:`pytest.RaisesGroup`. ``RaisesGroup`` includes the ability to specify multiple different expected exceptions, the structure of nested exception groups, and flags for emulating :ref:`except* <except_star>`. See :ref:`assert-matching-exception-groups` and docstrings for more information.
